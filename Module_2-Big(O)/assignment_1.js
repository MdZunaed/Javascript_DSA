/**
 * üïí Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * ------------------------------
 * ‚ùì Explaination of why the time complexity is O(n):
 *    - The function iterates through the entire array once.
 *    - Each element is accessed and added to `sum`, making it a linear operation.
 *    - The number of operations is directly proportional to `n` (size of the array).
 * 
 * ------------------------------
 * 
 * üîπ What is the time complexity if the array is empty?
 *    - O(1) (The loop doesn't execute, only initialization and return statement run.)
 * 
 * ------------------------------
 * 
 * üîπ What is the time complexity if all elements are negative?
 *    - O(n) (The loop still runs `n` times; the sign of elements doesn‚Äôt affect complexity.)
 * 
 * ------------------------------
 * 
 * üîπ What is the time complexity if the array contains only one element?
 *    - O(1) (The loop runs only once, which is constant time.)
